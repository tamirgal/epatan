      <p>Comments: Pauline,.. born in Rochester, New York.<br>Pauline is a student at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp; She is majoring in Art History with an emphasis on the Italian Renaissance.&nbsp; After graduating from Hopkins, she plans to go on to medical school. <br> As her parents, we have had the keenest pleasure raising her.&nbsp; It is now the turn of those whose life she touches to enjoy her multiple talents and her generous heart!&nbsp; She is unmatched in the breadth of her interests, which she executes with verve, polish and precision.&nbsp; The day she dissected a frozen squirrel while we gazed incredulous and fascinated will remain forever etched in our mind for the precision, the authority and the stunning quality of her performance!&nbsp; <br>We named Pauline after her wonderful grandmother Pauline Cohen Israel whose kindness, intelligence and indomitable spirit are legendary.&nbsp; Pauline resembles her grandmother not only physically, but also in spirit, in mind and in the strength of her character.&nbsp; When Pauline was a toddler and we were together in a pool in the scorching sun, I, her mother, remarked that the sun was &quot;very very strong&quot; that day.&nbsp; Pauline, whom I was holding in my arms, stared at me with a look of incomprehension, offended by the remark, she asked anxiously &quot;stronger than me?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No&quot; I said &quot;nobody and nothing is stronger than you&quot;!&nbsp; Pauline carries that confidence in a quiet and unassuming way.&nbsp; I hope you get a chance to know her one day!&nbsp; <br>Here is her e-mail address:&nbsp; … …&nbsp; Ppellet1@jhu.edu.<br></p>
