      <p>Comments: Chloe,.. born in Rochester, New York.<br>Chloe loves soccer, pizza and playing silly with her friends!&nbsp; We call her the ice storm baby because the week she was born a great big ice storm hit Rochester, New York.&nbsp; The city practically shut down due to falling tree branches on power lines. Without heat or electricity, we had to spend the week before Chlo?&#39;s birth at our good friends&#39; Ruth Gross and Hans Kellner.&nbsp; The experience was exciting and the city was dazzling all covered in ice.&nbsp; Thus was born a most delightful child! <br> Her speed, her imagination and her inexhaustible energy coupled with her unswerving sense of justice and her love of beauty have made her the apple of our eyes.&nbsp; May you all have a chance to get to know her and listen to her play the violin or the piano.&nbsp; She plays with heart, with intelligence and with a speed that has made even her better teachers respectful! <br>Chloe&#39;s middle name, Madeleine, derives from that of her paternal grandmother, Madeleine Boucher Pelletier, a woman of so much kindness and profound inner beauty.&nbsp; We chose her first name, Chlo?, because, pronounced in English -- as it would often be in the United States -- it sounded like a resounding and joyful French&quot; oui,&quot; or YES!&nbsp; and pronounced in French it would ring out a gleeful and boisterous &quot;oh?&quot;!&nbsp; <br>Here is her e-mail address: … … Midfielder913@aol.com.<br></p>
