      <p>Comments: I was born in Cairo, Egypt (March 18.1945). <br>I immigrated to the United States with my parents, in December 1967. Married to Sorana Blanar (March 15.1975), and actually living in Boston MA.<br>During the Six Days war in 1967 I was expelled from the country, a little ahead of my intended departure. I encapsulated my personal Exodus story in a narrative that could be read in its entirety in the links provided below.<br>http://www.universaloddities.com/exodus/intro.shtml<br> I am glad I have decided to commit the story to writing, and also glad I did it 35 years later; this allowed me to reflect on who I was and currently am. I have not learned to hate, even though the Exodus experience had its dark moments; and I yearn for peace in the Middle East more so now than ever. <br>Here is an abstract of my Personal Exodus Story<br>This story was written as the positive act of a &#39;witness&#39;, witnessing what transpired to my family and me, during the early days of June 1967; having been deported from Egypt and having immigrated subsequently to America. The story starts on the first day of the &#39;six days&#39; war and takes us step by step from jail to jail and finally onto a freighter to reach the first safe haven of many, Crete, Koln, Paris and finally America.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During these events, I report on what happened, what I saw and experienced as well as how I felt; as they say &quot;the good, the bad and yes the ugly&quot; is portrayed uncensored. You&#39;ll meet my companions on our trek, you&#39;ll get to know me and other fellow Jews with all our strength and weaknesses, i.e. warts and all; while trying to cope with the hardships imposed upon us for the one basic reason, we were Jews living in an Arab country.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During our exodus we met people that helped us and extended a helping hand on the spot; lifting our spirit in the process so we don&#39;t succumb to desolation and despair, especially when we most needed it. Can one imagine exiting from a train station in Paris with nowhere to go! Yet we found ourselves in the open arms of one Jewish community after another. We will re-experience together, my emotional reunion with my family living in France and with my parents after we were rejoined in Paris.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not simply a flat narration of events, though harrowing or even &#39;humorous&#39; at times it might have been, it was important as well to record how I felt and how such events affected me in the near and long term.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the hardships of my Exodus experience I still see myself as a peace loving Jew. I have not learned to hate, and I strongly believe that &quot;hate only begets hate&quot;! I cannot see myself hating, and if understandably then, then definitely not now, and that if all I have learned from my Exodus experience was to hate, I would consider my life a totally wasted one. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see my Personal Abstract and full Exodus story, on the Internet, press on the link below:<br><a href="http://www.universaloddities.com/exodus/intro.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.universaloddities.com/exodus/intro.shtml<br>
