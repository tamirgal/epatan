      <p>Comments: Chaya Farkas,&nbsp; born&nbsp; in Tjacev (Tecso) (Tacovo). She lived in this small village, with her family and some 1500 Jews. . <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the origin, the village was under the Austro-Hungarian government, …in 1920, it passed to the new Czechoslovakian state. After some years, it was shifted back to Hungary, untill&nbsp; World War 2.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many Jewish villages in the area, it was victim of the Nazi persecution, and their &quot;Final solution&quot;. Jews were gathered in central ghetto in the village.&nbsp; Some were sent to Nazi labor camps, while others were deported to Auschwitz and other extermination camps, between the years 1942-1944.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was also the destiny of the Farkash family, … Some members died in that holocaust, some escaped, some&nbsp; survived, in spite their capture and detention in those camps, … Chaya , and her 3 sisters survived, and were liberated at the end of the war in 1945 . The rest of the family died in the Holaucost.<br>Sara decided to immigrate to the USA, but Chaya, Tsipora and Miriam decidedto immigrate to Palestine.<br>For preparing their&nbsp; Aliyah, they were sent to Italy.<br>There, Chaya met Moshe Goldstein<br>, whom&nbsp; she married&nbsp; in 1946 and&nbsp; boarded together on the ship &quot;Bracha Fold&quot;, en route to Israel.<br>Near the coast of Israel, the ship was captured by British navy troops and&nbsp; all passengers&nbsp; were deported to Cyprus. They were detained&nbsp; for 9 months before their release and arrived in Israel in September 1947.<br>As a group , they were sent to kibutz &quot;Messilot&quot;, in the Beit-Shean valley.<br>After a short while, they left to Haifa, where&nbsp; Moshe started to work&nbsp; in the building construction untill he was drafted to the young IDF (Israel defense force), to participate in the independance war. <br>He was released&nbsp; in early 1950,and started to work as a telecom technician,&nbsp; in the israely&nbsp; PTT, in Haifa&nbsp; where he worked for more than 40 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>To learn more about the&nbsp; Farkas Goldstein family, visit its site <br>at :
