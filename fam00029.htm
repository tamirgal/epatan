Pauline,.. born in Rochester, New York.<br>Pauline is a student at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp; She is majoring in Art History with an emphasis on the Italian Renaissance.&nbsp; After graduating from Hopkins, she plans to go on to medical school. <br> As her parents, we have had the keenest pleasure raising her.&nbsp; It is now the turn of those whose life she touches to enjoy her multiple talents and her generous heart!&nbsp; She is unmatched in the breadth of her interests, which she executes with verve, polish and precision.&nbsp; The day she dissected a frozen squirrel while we gazed incredulous and fascinated will remain forever etched in our mind for the precision, the authority and the stunning quality of her performance!&nbsp; <br>We named Pauline after her wonderful grandmother Pauline Cohen Israel whose kindness, intelligence and indomitable spirit are legendary.&nbsp; Pauline resembles her grandmother not only physically, but also in spirit, in mind and in the strength of her character.&nbsp; When Pauline was a toddler and we were together in a pool in the scorching sun, I, her mother, remarked that the sun was &quot;very very strong&quot; that day.&nbsp; Pauline, whom I was holding in my arms, stared at me with a look of incomprehension, offended by the remark, she asked anxiously &quot;stronger than me?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No&quot; I said &quot;nobody and nothing is stronger than you&quot;!&nbsp; Pauline carries that confidence in a quiet and unassuming way.&nbsp; I hope you get a chance to know her one day!&nbsp; <br>Here is her e-mail address:&nbsp; … …&nbsp; Ppellet1@jhu.edu.<br></td>

Chloe,.. born in Rochester, New York.<br>Chloe loves soccer, pizza and playing silly with her friends!&nbsp; We call her the ice storm baby because the week she was born a great big ice storm hit Rochester, New York.&nbsp; The city practically shut down due to falling tree branches on power lines. Without heat or electricity, we had to spend the week before Chlo?&#39;s birth at our good friends&#39; Ruth Gross and Hans Kellner.&nbsp; The experience was exciting and the city was dazzling all covered in ice.&nbsp; Thus was born a most delightful child! <br> Her speed, her imagination and her inexhaustible energy coupled with her unswerving sense of justice and her love of beauty have made her the apple of our eyes.&nbsp; May you all have a chance to get to know her and listen to her play the violin or the piano.&nbsp; She plays with heart, with intelligence and with a speed that has made even her better teachers respectful! <br>Chloe&#39;s middle name, Madeleine, derives from that of her paternal grandmother, Madeleine Boucher Pelletier, a woman of so much kindness and profound inner beauty.&nbsp; We chose her first name, Chlo?, because, pronounced in English -- as it would often be in the United States -- it sounded like a resounding and joyful French&quot; oui,&quot; or YES!&nbsp; and pronounced in French it would ring out a gleeful and boisterous &quot;oh?&quot;!&nbsp; <br>Here is her e-mail address: … … Midfielder913@aol.com.<br></td>
